        <h1>Hello, W-.. Web!</h1>
        <aside>This is <em> your </em> website.</aside>
    </header>

    <h2>It's <span>minimal</span> and <span>bland</span>, but be careful!</h2>

    <p><strong>It's also got a <em>lot</em> going for it:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lightweight and effective</li>
        <li>Compatible with all different screens and browsers</li>
        <li>Accessible for all of your visitors</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>You probably still want to change it</h2>

    <p>And you probably should, but by making it more personal and (hopefully) beautiful, you may just sacrifice what you already had.</p>

    <h2>So be careful.</h2>
    <p>Sometimes it's better to be basic.</p>

    <h2>Minimal, not default.</h2>
    <p>Make sure it is truly better. You may think the margins are too large, and for desktop: you may just be right! On a phone, you may just have to scroll. But this website <em>isn't</em> sacrificing for mobile. You also aren't a giraffe; it's a whole lot easier to read when it isn't across the entire breadth of the screen or in the corners and edges</p>

    <h2>I'm done preaching</h2>
    <p>It was serious, but I really just wanted to force a scroll for my basic webpage. Oh - and put this <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">link</a>.</p>
